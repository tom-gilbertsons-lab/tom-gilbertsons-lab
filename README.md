## How to... 

### Add yourself to the lab pages


The `_layouts/people.html` layout can be used to showcase and describe people in your research group. People are defined in the `_data/settings.yml` file, and markdown pages for each person with the `_layouts/page.html` layout can be placed in the `people` directory. Upload a nice picture (recomment about 900x900 pixels)



## Front page
Home pages shows some info and also recent 'posts' if you want to use them. They can also just be deleted or not used,
he `_layouts/home.html` layout defines the home page for this theme. An introduction to your research group or to yourself can be provided, along with a list of featured publications. There is also a section for providing any updates through posts placed in the `_posts` directory.

### Add a post to the posts

Direct links to the paper can be used, or a PDF copy of the paper can be served.
